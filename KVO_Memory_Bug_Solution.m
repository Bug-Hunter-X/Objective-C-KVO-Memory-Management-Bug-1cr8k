To fix this, ensure you remove the observer in the `-dealloc` method of the observing object.  Also, add a check to ensure the object is still valid before removing the observer. Here's how you might modify the code:

```objectivec
@implementation MyObserver

- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // ... your observation logic ...
}

- (void)dealloc {
    if (self.observedObject) {
        [self.observedObject removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@"myProperty"];
    }
    [super dealloc];
}

@end
```
This ensures that the observer is always removed before the observer object is deallocated, preventing crashes and memory corruption.
